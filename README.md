# Sarcasm Detector

## Introduction



## Objectives

Our primary objective in the following project will be to develop deep neural networks and other classifiers that provide accurate classification models for determining whether a given headline is sarcastic or nonsarcastic. Furthermore, we will explore characteristics of our headline data overall, as well as in the context of sarcastic and non-sarcastic subsets.

Additional sections are labeled accordingly and include the following research questions:

* What proportion of articles are sarcastic? Non-sarcastic?
* How many total words are in our overall dataset? Total sarcastic words? Total non-sarcastic words?
* How many of these words are unique within our dataset? Unique sarcastic words? Unique non-sarcastic words?
* Which words are most common in headlines (including stopwords)? Most common in sarcastic headlines? Most common in non-sarcastic headlines?
* Which words, excluding stopwords, are most common in our three groups of headlines?
* With stopwords removed, which bigrams and trigrams are most populous in our headlines?
* How do these measures reflect cultural trends relevant to the time period?
* Using the Word2Vec vectorizer, how do initial classification models perform in differentiating between sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines?
* Which types of RNNs can perform better than these intial models?
* What future work is possible based upon our findings in this project?
